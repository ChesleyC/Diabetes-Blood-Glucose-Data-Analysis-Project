The task needs to analyze time-series data. Following is a publicly available dataset and its corresponding paper (optional).

This dataset contains blood glucose level throughout the day while their eating events are marked from type 1 and type 2 diabetes participants.

1) Create a dataframe for each user. 
2) Generally, you'll see blood glucose levels spike after meals in this data; demonstrate this visually with plots.
3) For a single user: from all their daily data, determine the rate at which blood glucose spikes and drops after a meal. How does this change with the type of meal, i.e., the difference between breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
4) Now, group users based on whether they have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Can you identify any patterns in the rate? What do you find interesting or not interesting here? For example, individuals with type 1 diabetes are known to require a longer time to normalize their blood glucose levels compared to those with type 2 diabetes. Do you see that in this dataset?
5) Create a simple machine learning model that predicts how long it will take for blood glucose levels to return to normal at each mealtime. Don't worry about the complexity of the model; instead, focus on your intuition about which features could be useful. You can use a linear model. Use the dataframe's create in step 1), train this model on {N-1} users and test on the {N}th user, iterate this till all users are covered. We call this Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation in literature.

Notes: Create your own definitions in places that are vague (for example, what does it mean by a spike?). 

Need to demonstrate how to handle the data at the circumstances out of the given questions, and show the thought process.
